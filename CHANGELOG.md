# Changelog

All notable changes to the `pi-intercom` extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Hand busy interactive inbound messages directly to Pi's safe steering queue instead of waiting for aggregate idle, preventing stale coordination from appearing hours after it was received. See #86.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- Avoid relaunching standalone Pi executables as the Node runtime when starting the default broker process. Thanks to ZacharyQin for PR #82 and to jeffutter and awaae001 for confirming the impact.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Scoped name-based queued-mail redelivery to sessions that also match the target's directory. A disconnected session's queued messages, including replies addressed to its exact session ID, could previously be delivered to an unrelated same-named session in a different project folder. Directories compare through the same normalization used by `list-cwd`, so a relaunch reporting the same directory via a trailing slash or symlink still receives its mail.

### Changed
- Rewrote the broker frame reader as a bounded state machine and made frame writes a single allocation, removing quadratic `Buffer.concat` accumulation on fragmented socket reads (up to ~28x faster on heavily fragmented frames).
- Cached the collapsed preview and width-keyed wrapped body lines in the inline message renderer, cutting repeated rerender cost of long messages by ~2-3x while keeping live theme changes applied per render.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- Added a bounded in-memory broker mailbox so replies to recently disconnected named CLI senders are queued and delivered when a process reconnects with the same name. Thanks to Luke (`valkyriweb`) for issue #63.
- Added protocol-visible delivery metadata, receiver lifecycle receipts, receiver-side inbound message dedupe, explicit cancel/supersede controls, and clearer ask-timeout receipts for ordered delivery diagnostics. Thanks to Donnie Thomas (`donnielrt`) for issue #65.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- Added opt-in restart-stable intercom session IDs via `PI_INTERCOM_STABLE_ID` or `stableId` in `config.json`. Thanks to iRonin for issue #39.
- Added `/intercom-id` to insert a stable handoff snippet for the current session into the editor. Thanks to dataforxyz for PR #60.
- Added `intercom({ action: "list-cwd" })` to list peers scoped to the same working directory. Thanks to iRonin for PR #58.
- Added live context-window usage to session presence and list output. Thanks to iRonin for PR #59.
- Added a silent namespaced extension bus for non-conversational extension coordination. Thanks to Kieran Bond for PR #69.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Documented `PI_INTERCOM_ASK_TIMEOUT_MS` for configurable ask/supervisor timeouts. Thanks to wiansapu for issue #14.
- Clarified session addressing copy so the short IDs shown by `list` are documented as usable prefixes. Thanks to Grant Hutchins for PR #66.
- Updated Pi runtime peer metadata and tool schemas for the `@earendil-works` package scope and Pi-bundled `typebox`/`pi-ai` packages.
- Centralized pi-intercom runtime and config paths under `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` when set, defaulting to `~/.pi/agent`.
- Hardened default broker auto-spawn to launch the resolved bundled `tsx` CLI through the current Node executable instead of resolving `npx` through `PATH`; custom `brokerCommand`/`brokerArgs` remain available as advanced trusted config.
- Added an `inboundTrigger` policy (`always`, `replies`, or `never`) so users can reduce inbound auto-trigger risk while preserving existing behavior by default.
- Made inline intercom messages collapse and expand with Pi's `Ctrl+O` custom-message toggle while keeping sender, preview, reply, and attachment cues visible. Thanks to RyanKim17920 for PR #32.
- Improved inline message theme hierarchy with separate semantic styling for borders, headers, body text, and metadata. Thanks to Sreenath for PR #68.

### Fixed
- Added broker-owned local trust metadata, clearer stable-ID trust boundaries for duplicate names, per-connection rate limiting, and no-op presence coalescing for local IPC abuse hardening.
- Added an inbound broker frame size cap to reject oversized local IPC messages before buffering their payloads.
- Restricted Unix intercom runtime directory, socket, PID, and spawn-lock permissions.
- Rechecked single-flight ask state after session target resolution so concurrent regular asks fail safely instead of crashing on an unhandled rejected reply waiter.
- Refused broker-level mutual asks that would deadlock two sessions, and cleared outstanding ask edges when asks are replied to, cancelled, or disconnected.
- Stabilized intercom session addressing across reconnects, idle `/name` changes, replaced Pi sessions, supervisor routing, pending replies, and short-ID targeting.
- Aligned intercom overlay widths with their rendered modal boxes. Thanks to Cat for PR #43.
- Marked failed `intercom` and `contact_supervisor` tool results through Pi's `tool_result` error flag path while preserving structured renderer details.
- Limited the intercom overlay to TUI mode and unsubscribed subagent relay event handlers during session shutdown.
- Added an opt-in Windows localhost TCP transport using a dynamic port, broker protocol health checks, and a local endpoint secret instead of a fixed-port default.
- Stabilized reply/supervisor routing by respecting explicit reply targets, suppressing legacy supervisor tools when native supervisor channels are present, and clearing replied idle-queued asks. Thanks to ThanhNT29Jacky for PR #64.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Added `brokerCommand` and `brokerArgs` config options for choosing the broker runtime command. Thanks to William Fligor for PR #12.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Busy interactive sessions now queue inbound intercom messages until the receiver is idle instead of aborting the active turn.
- Sessions now publish automatic lifecycle status (`idle`, `thinking`, or `tool:<name>`) through intercom presence updates.
- Deferred startup connection, delayed inbound flushes, overlay work, reconnect attempts, and relay callbacks now guard against stale session contexts after shutdown or reload.
- `intercom` and `contact_supervisor` tool calls/results now use compact custom transcript renderers.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added `contact_supervisor` `reason: "interview_request"` for child subagents to send structured supervisor interviews, wait for a reply, and receive parsed JSON replies in tool result details when available.

### Fixed
- Busy non-interactive sessions now auto-reply to top-level intercom messages instead of aborting and losing the message.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added a `contact_supervisor` tool for `pi-subagents` child sessions so delegated agents can request supervisor decisions or send meaningful progress updates with run metadata.
- Documented subagent-to-supervisor escalation in the README and bundled `pi-intercom` skill.

### Fixed
- Made inline intercom message cards use the available terminal width instead of a narrow fixed width.
- Cleared supervisor ask waiters correctly after cancellation or delivery failure so subagents can ask again.

### Changed
- Stopped tracking `package-lock.json` and ignored local `progress.md` memory files.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Added `pi-subagents` grouped result relay support over `pi-intercom`, including delivery acknowledgments so parent runs can return compact receipts only after the orchestrator receives the result message.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- Delivered `pi-subagents` needs-attention control events to the orchestrator over intercom.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Added receiver-side `reply` ergonomics for inbound asks. Agents can now use `intercom({ action: "reply", message })` in the triggered turn or later against a single pending ask, plus `intercom({ action: "pending" })` to inspect unresolved inbound asks.

### Fixed
- Migrated extension tool schemas from `@sinclair/typebox` to `typebox` 1.x so packaged installs follow Pi's current extension runtime contract.
- Included `reply-tracker.ts` in the published package so installed extensions can load the new reply-tracking helper at runtime.
- Updated the integration test harness to set `USERPROFILE` alongside `HOME`, keeping temp-home isolation reliable on Windows.

### Changed
- Moved TypeBox from `peerDependencies` to a real `dependencies` entry so `pi install` production installs keep the schema package available at runtime.
- Incoming ask reply hints now prefer `intercom({ action: "reply", ... })` instead of exposing raw `to` and `replyTo` identifiers.
- Updated the bundled `pi-intercom` skill and README examples to prefer `reply`/`pending` over manual reply threading.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Bundled `pi-intercom` skill with coordination patterns, error handling, constraints, and optional cmux/tmux peer-session spawning for visible multi-session workflows.
- `pi.skills` manifest in `package.json` so `pi install` loads the skill automatically.
- AGENTS.md snippet in README recommending a project-level coordination hint for agents.
- Attachments example to Quick Start section in README.

### Changed
- Incoming message reply hints now say "To reply, use the intercom tool:" instead of "— reply:" so agents are more likely to use the intercom tool instead of replying inline.
- `ask` action now documents the one-at-a-time constraint in the Tool Reference.
- `status` action now clarifies that the session count includes the current session.
- Broker startup no longer uses a non-null assertion for sender session lookup in the `send` handler — missing sessions now produce a `delivery_failed` response instead of a crash.
- Broker spawn lock error handling tightened to check `instanceof Error` before accessing `.code`.
- Broker PID parsing now guards against `NaN` from corrupt PID files.
- `isConnected()` readability cleanup in `IntercomClient`.
- README file structure updated to include `broker/paths.ts`, test files, and `skills/` directory.
- README runtime files section now clarifies that `broker.sock` is macOS/Linux only; Windows uses a named pipe.
- README mermaid diagram changed "Unix Socket" to "Local Socket/Pipe" for cross-platform accuracy.
- README broker limitation rephrased from "must be running" to "auto-spawns on first use and exits when idle."
- README Install section now mentions that the bundled skill is registered on startup.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Broker startup now works on Windows by launching the local `tsx` CLI through a hidden `wscript.exe` helper without treating the helper's expected early exit as a broker failure.

### Changed
- The broker now uses a Windows named pipe instead of a Unix socket on Windows, while keeping the existing Unix socket transport on macOS and Linux.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Declared the extension entry in `package.json` via `pi.extensions` so `pi install npm:pi-intercom` can discover and load the extension from the npm package.

### Changed
- Added `pi-package` package metadata plus peer dependency declarations for every Pi runtime package the extension imports, including `@mariozechner/pi-tui`.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Intercom sessions now reconnect automatically after broker disconnects or sleep/wake interruptions instead of staying offline until reload or restart.
- Replaced raw runtime `console.error` intercom disconnect logging with silent recovery so transient broker churn no longer splashes stray text into the Pi TUI.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Unnamed sessions now register a runtime-only `subagent-chat-<id>` intercom alias instead of persisting a generic session title into Pi session history, so `pi --resume` can keep showing transcript snippets while unnamed sessions remain reachable over intercom.
- Intercom presence updates now refresh the advertised session name during later turn/intercom activity, so renaming a session does not leave subagents and peers targeting a stale startup alias.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Busy incoming intercom messages now try a graceful detach handshake with `pi-subagents` before falling back to interrupting the active turn.
- Reply follow-ups are deferred and re-delivered as follow-up wakeups so final confirmation messages stop causing unnecessary `Operation aborted` interruptions.
- Unnamed sessions now auto-register a stable `session-<id>` display name so orchestrators and delegated children can target each other reliably without a manual `/name`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Switched intercom send confirmation to opt-in. `send` now delivers immediately by default, and interactive confirmation only appears when `confirmSend: true` is set in `~/.pi/agent/intercom/config.json`.
- Replaced the old inverted `autoSend` config with `confirmSend` to make the behavior easier to understand.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Added an MIT `LICENSE` file and set `package.json` `license` to `MIT`.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to mention the `pi-subagents` integration and link to https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Clearer self vs peer identity** — `intercom({ action: "list" })` now shows `Current session` and `Other sessions`, includes short session IDs, and marks same-folder peers with `[same cwd]` so agents are less likely to mistake another session in the same repo for themselves.
- **Picker self anchor** — The session picker now shows the current session as a disabled `[self]` row at the top while keeping only peer sessions selectable.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **Reply flows skip approval** — `send` calls that include `replyTo` now bypass the confirmation dialog so reply-hint conversations can continue without an extra approval step.
- **Overlay readability** — The session picker now shows session name/model on the first line and the cwd on a second line with middle truncation, making long paths much easier to distinguish.
- **Documentation clarity** — The README now explains which sessions appear in the picker, how sessions become intercom-connected, and the difference between user-facing `/intercom` usage and agent tool calls.

### Fixed
- **Compose overlay crash** — Replaced the invalid `tui.scheduleRender()` calls with `tui.requestRender()`, fixing the compose overlay crash while typing or sending.
- **Overlay panel chrome** — Restored bordered modal rendering for the session picker and compose overlay so they display as proper overlays instead of floating unboxed content.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Added a `promptSnippet` for the `intercom` tool so Pi 0.59+ includes it in the default tool prompt section and improves session-to-session coordination discoverability.

### Changed
- **Pi compatibility refresh** — Updated the extension to match current Pi lifecycle and custom UI APIs, including `session_start` / `session_shutdown` and injected `ctx.ui.custom()` keybindings.
- **Overlay keybindings** — The session picker and compose overlay now use injected, namespaced Pi keybindings instead of reading editor-global bindings directly.
- **Session list correlation** — `list` / `sessions` now carry a `requestId`, so a delayed broker reply cannot be mistaken for a newer session-list request.
- **Reply sends skip approval** — `send` calls that include `replyTo` now bypass the confirmation dialog so reply-hint flows work without an extra approval step.
- **Documentation accuracy** — The README now matches the current implementation, including request correlation, persistence behavior, broker disconnect behavior, and the file layout.

### Fixed
- **Protocol state handling** — Broker and client now reject malformed, unknown, duplicate, and out-of-order protocol messages instead of silently accepting them.
- **Duplicate-name routing** — Sends to a duplicated session name now fail with an explicit error instead of routing to the first match.
- **Delivery failure visibility** — `delivery_failed.reason` now flows through the client, tool results, and compose overlay error UI.
- **Disconnect and startup errors** — Broker spawn failures, early broker exits, protocol failures, and disconnects now preserve the real error instead of collapsing to generic messages.
- **Disconnect-time writes** — Client operations now fail cleanly during disconnect instead of writing to a closing socket and triggering `write after end` errors.
- **Late-response handling** — Timed-out send/list requests no longer disconnect the client, and delayed list responses can no longer contaminate a later request with stale data.
- **Config validation** — Invalid intercom config values are now reported and ignored instead of silently producing a broken runtime config.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`ask` action** — `intercom({ action: "ask", to, message })` now sends a message and blocks until the recipient replies, returning the reply as the tool result. Includes a 10-minute timeout, abort handling, disconnect handling, and shutdown cleanup.
- **Exact reply hints** — Incoming messages can now include a ready-to-run reply command that uses the sender's exact session ID as `to` and the original message ID as `replyTo`, making synchronous `ask`/reply flows reliable.
- **Attachment body rendering for incoming messages** — Incoming attachment contents are now appended to the agent-visible message body so recipients can read attached file/snippet/context content directly.
- **Planner/worker workflow documentation** — README now documents the intended planner-worker loop, including `send` vs `ask`, clarification patterns, and reply-hint behavior.

### Changed
- **Session target resolution** — `send` and `ask` now resolve a unique case-insensitive session name to its exact session ID before sending. Ambiguous names are rejected instead of guessed.
- **Duplicate-name presentation** — Session labels are now disambiguated consistently across `list`, the session picker, the compose overlay, and send notifications by appending a short session ID when names collide.
- **Send confirmation dialog** — Confirmation text now includes attachment content previews and `replyTo` metadata so outgoing messages are reviewed accurately before sending.
- **Inline message rendering** — The custom inline renderer now shows the fully rendered message body, optional reply command, attachment summaries, and reply metadata consistently with what the agent receives.

### Fixed
- **False `ask` completions from unrelated messages** — Reply matching now requires an exact `replyTo` match and the expected sender, preventing unrelated incoming messages from unblocking a waiting `ask`.
- **Self-targeted messages** — `send` and `ask` now reject attempts to message the current session instead of allowing loops or self-waits.
- **Undelivered `ask` cleanup** — If an `ask` message is not delivered, the waiting state is torn down cleanly instead of lingering.
- **Inline renderer/body mismatch** — The custom message renderer now matches the actual delivered message body for messages with attachments instead of showing a reduced view.
- **Duplicate-name ambiguity when self shares a name** — Duplicate-name detection now considers all connected sessions, so another session is still disambiguated when it shares a name with the current session.
- **`broker/client.ts` `sessions` switch scoping** — Braced the `sessions` case to avoid block-scoping hazards in the message handler.
